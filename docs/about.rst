About
=====

Minethink is a 3D block based sandbox game.
It is currently in development.

My goal with this project is to improve my skills in 3D rendering and C++
development.

This project will likely **NOT** have an API, so if you are looking for
an extensible sandbox block game, please see
`Minetest <https://github.com/minetest/minetest>`__.
